`passphrase` is a command-line tool for generating strong
[Diceware](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware) passphrases using
[EFF](https://www.eff.org/)'s long wordlist.

In short, passphrases are generated by "throwing" five dice, joining the numbers
into one, then looking up the word with the corresponding number in the
wordlist, and repeating this process until N words (six, by default) are found.
See more information about the technique [here](https://www.eff.org/dice).

Instead of generating strings consisting of random numbers, letters, and
symbols, `passphrase` produces passphrases such as `whinny daffodil aerobics
upheld bankable niece` which are easier to memorize while still extremely hard
to guess by brute force.

Under the hood, `passphrase` uses
[`rio`](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio) as a prelude replacement and
[Cryptonite](https://github.com/haskell-crypto/cryptonite) for generating random
numbers.

## Requirements
* [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

## Usage
* Build the project: `stack build`.
* Generate a passphrase: `stack exec -- passphrase [WORDLIST] [-n LENGTH]`.

To run the test suite, run `stack test`.
